# GPUI Community Edition

A community fork of [GPUI](https://gpui.rs), Zed's GPU-accelerated UI framework.

## About

This fork is based on GPUI 0.2.2, extracted from the [Zed editor](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) codebase. The goal is to continue developing GPUI as a standalone framework for building desktop applications.
