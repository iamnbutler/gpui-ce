# GPUI Community Edition

A community fork of [GPUI](https://gpui.rs), Zed's GPU-accelerated UI framework.

Currently forked from the crates.io gpui 0.2.2 sournce - will likely be re-initialized from the `zed-industries/zed` repo so we can maintain the git history.

### Direction

This project will likely streamline gpui, focusing on it's use as a general purpose UI framework rather than being tightly coupled to Zed.

GPUI was created by [Zed Industries](https://zed.dev). This fork exists to continue gpui development while the Zed team focuses on other things.
